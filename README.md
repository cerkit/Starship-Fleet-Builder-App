# Overview
I recently found a new Starship Combat game made by Fat Dragon Games<sup>TM</sup>. I couldn't find a utility that let me generate and print a fleet list. 
I needed someting that would list the ships, allow me to add them to my fleet list, and keep a running total of my ships. 
It also had to have the ability to save a fleet to disk (along with its name) and allow for later importing. Printing was a priority too; I wanted
to be able to print the fleet list so I could easily build it at the gaming table. For completion sake, I also needed a CSV export.

## Solution
I decided to make it a single `.html` file so that it would be easy to integrate with my blog (Astro blog engine). 
Because it's a single file, it also runs locally in Safari and Edge.

## Call for help
